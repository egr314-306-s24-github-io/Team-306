            <p>Our team’s objective is to invent a product that can help users with their carbon footprint and have a great effect on the environment. We will also be implementing the uses of sensors and motors that can help create a sturdy system where it is possible to measure weather parameters including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Our team also has intentions to input actuation mechanisms to have a responsive actuation system that can autonomously react to the environmental data that will be collected. Our planned products are to be developed as user-friendly as well as create an intuitive user interface for configuring and monitoring the environment. We also want to ensure a secure MQTT communication in which we will be implementing a robust communication system using the MQTT protocol to securely transmit environmental data over WiFi where we can prioritize data integrity, confidentiality, and availability to ensure the information is transmitted properly and efficiently.</p>
