<p>Our teamâ€™s objective is to invent a product that can help users reduce their carbon footprint and have a positive impact on the environment. We will be implementing the use of sensors and motors to create a robust system capable of measuring weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Additionally, we plan to incorporate actuation mechanisms to create a responsive system that can autonomously react to the environmental data collected.</p>

<p>Our planned product will be developed to be user-friendly, with an intuitive user interface for configuring and monitoring the environment. We also aim to ensure secure MQTT communication by implementing a robust communication system using the MQTT protocol to securely transmit environmental data over WiFi. This will allow us to prioritize data integrity, confidentiality, and availability, ensuring that information is transmitted properly and efficiently.</p>
