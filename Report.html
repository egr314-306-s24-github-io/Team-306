<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Our team’s objective is to invent a product that can help users with their carbon footprint and have a great effect on the environment. We will also be implementing the uses of sensors and motors that can help create a sturdy system where it is possible to measure weather parameters including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Our team also has intentions to input actuation mechanisms to have a responsive actuation system that can autonomously react to the environmental data that will be collected. Our planned products are to be developed as user-friendly as well as create an intuitive user interface for configuring and monitoring the environment. We also want to ensure a secure MQTT communication in which we will be implementing a robust communication system using the MQTT protocol to securely transmit environmental data over WiFi where we can prioritize data integrity, confidentiality, and availability to ensure the information is transmitted properly and efficiently.</p>

<h2 id="team-coordination-accountability">Team Coordination & Accountability</h2>
<p>Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment?</p>
<p>Our assignment leader will keep track of due dates and ensure the team is on pace to meet deadlines and turn in assignments.</p>
<p>Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and how will you adjust if not?</p>
<p>We will demonstrate and inform each other of our strengths and weaknesses to ensure we are getting the best out of each other. If someone is having trouble we will have each other's backs and work together to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team?</p>
<p>We will all take the feedback to heart as we want to create the best design and take criticism to ensure our product will only get better and fix any flaws that it has.</p>
<p>Address missed contributions/assignments/actions?</p>
<p>We will talk to the person who isn’t contributing and try to have them make up the work before the deadline and if they continue to not contribute we will have to let the instructor know about their performance on the team.</p>
<p>Hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter.</p>
<p>We are a team and if someone isn’t holding down their part it will only ruin the team. Therefore, we expect each other to be held accountable for what we do as we are working to be future engineers and possibly leaders in the future.</p>
<p>Recognize that a team member is underperforming.</p>
<p>We will talk with the team members and discuss what is going on and what could help them perform better. However, if no communication is done and underperforming continues then the professor will need to get involved and will be informed.</p>
<p>Help an underperforming team member improve.</p>

<h2 id="user-needs">User Needs</h2>
<p>Conducting separate individual research based on our inspired products from other vendors, our team was able to pitch up a list of customer needs that is neatly pilled into separate categories below. Our product must sense at least 2 of the following environmental conditions via at least 2 separate serial sensors: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and based on our recent studies on our user needs we are mainly going to be focusing on the safety, design, and functionality of our future product. Features of our product requirement will include secure access, easy usage, durability, secure software, and accurate tracking.</p>
