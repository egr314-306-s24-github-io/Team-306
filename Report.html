Team 306 Final Report - Checkpoint 3

EGR 314

Team 306

Alex Nguyen, Saul Leon, Miguel Hernandez


# **Table of Contents:**


[TOC]



# **Introduction**

Our team’s objective is to invent a product that can help users with their carbon footprint and have a great effect on the environment. We will also be implementing the uses of sensors and motors that can help create a sturdy system where it is possible to measure weather parameters including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Our team also has intentions to input actuation mechanisms to have a responsive actuation system that can autonomously react to the environmental data that will be collected. Our planned products are to be developed as user-friendly as well as create an intuitive user interface for configuring and monitoring the environment. We also want to ensure a secure MQTT communication in which we will be implementing a robust communication system using the MQTT protocol to securely transmit environmental data over WiFi where we can prioritize data integrity, confidentiality, and availability to ensure the information is transmitted properly and efficiently.

**Team Organization**

_Charter -_ As a team, we will commit to upholding these goals and working collaboratively to achieve the mission of creating an exceptional design that fits all requirements needed for the project. We recognize the importance of innovation, reliability, and sustainability in our project, and will work as hard as we can to ensure that we succeed. 

_Mission Statement -** **_Using our creative ability, we plan on creating up to at least four ideas that could have the potential to reach one of the said goals and to help build up our skills and understanding when working with sensors related to the environment. The objective of team 306 is to create a product that is eco-friendly and low on budget, whether it’s reading humidity percentage in the air, moisture in the soil, or conserving power. One of our ideas was to create a device that could tell the humidity in the air or moisture in the soil around a plant using sensors so it could help notify users if the plant is in the right climate and perhaps using a motor to create a water pump to help moisture the plant’s dry surroundings. Another idea was to conserve energy with a miniature Turbine or a Temperature Stirling Engine that can convert its mechanical energy into electrical power.


### _Team Coordination & Accountability_



* Ensure that assignments are submitted before deadlines and each team member has "signed off" on each submitted assignment?

    **Our assignment leader will keep track of due dates and ensure the team is on pace to meet deadlines and turn in assignments.**

* Ensure that each team member has the knowledge and skill required for each assignment, and how will you adjust if not?

    **We will demonstrate and inform each other of our strengths and weaknesses to ensure we are getting the best out of each other. If someone is having trouble we will have each other's backs and work together to resolve the issue. **

* Ensure that feedback from your design review is distributed to and acted on by every member of the team?

    **We will all take the feedback to heart as we want to create the best design and take criticism to ensure our product will only get better and fix any flaws that it has. **

* Address missed contributions/assignments/actions?

    **We will talk to the person who isn’t contributing and try to have them make up the work before the deadline and if they continue to not contribute we will have to let the instructor know about their performance on the team. **

* Hold one another accountable to the expectations described in this charter.

    **We are a team and if someone isn’t holding down their part it will only ruin the team. Therefore, we expect each other to be held accountable for what we do as we are working to be future engineers and possibly leaders in the future. **

* Recognize that a team member is underperforming.

    **We will talk with the team members and discuss what is going on and what could help them perform better. However, if no communication is done and underperforming continues then the professor will need to get involved and will be informed. **

* Help an underperforming team member improve.


# **User Needs**

Conducting separate individual research based on our inspired products from other vendors, our team was able to pitch up a list of customer needs that is neatly pilled into separate categories below. Our product must sense at least 2 of the following environmental conditions via at least 2 separate serial sensors: temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, and based on our recent studies on our user needs we are mainly going to be focusing on the safety, design, and functionality of our future product. Features of our product requirement will include secure access, easy usage, durability, secure software, and accurate tracking

# **Product Requirements Document**

As a team, we will be creating a mobile weather station where we will broadcast our environmental data to the internet over WiFi using the MQTT protocol which we then will be working collaboratively to achieve the mission of creating an exceptional design that fits all requirements needed for the project. We recognize the importance of innovation, reliability, and sustainability in our project, and will work as hard as we can to ensure that we succeed. 

Using our creative ability, we plan on creating up to at least four ideas that could have the potential to reach one of the said goals and to help build up our skills and understanding when working with sensors related to the environment. The objective of team 306 is to create a product that is eco-friendly and low on budget, whether it’s reading humidity percentage in the air, moisture in the soil, or conserving power. One of our ideas was to create a device that could tell the humidity in the air or moisture in the soil around a plant using sensors so it could help notify users if the plant is in the right climate and perhaps using a motor to create a water pump to help moisture the plant’s dry surroundings. Another idea was to conserve energy with a miniature Turbine or a Temperature Stirling Engine that can convert its mechanical energy into electrical power.

**Stakeholders**

**Target group.** Anyone should be able to afford this device as cost will not be the main breaking point for the consumer. 

**Target purchaser_. _**Target group profiles are people who are looking for high-tech gadgets that help contribute to the environment. Also, students/researchers want to use a device that reads and outputs data that it is receiving. 

**Customer service.** Prefers easy-to-repair, recyclable products, and easy-to-fix complaints to fit with intuitive user experience.

**Marketing & Sales division**. Look for unique selling points around the consumer and community lifestyle and environment for a better user experience.

**Retailers**. Prefer products that can withstand a wide range of storage conditions including variations in temperature, vibration, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and have strong and compact, theft, and vandalism-proof packaging.

**Regulatory instances_. _**The product needs to comply with communication and privacy laws and environmental laws that will play into effect when this product is being used. We will need to implement quality control measures to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the environmental sensors. Consider standards such as ISO 9001 for quality management. Comply with product safety standards relevant to electronic devices and sensors. Certification marks like CE (Conformité Européenne) may be required for products sold in the European market.

**Use Cases**

**Use Instance #1 (Jane): Smart Plant Care Device**

Jane is an avid gardener who loves growing a variety of plants at home. She has a collection of indoor and outdoor plants with different climate preferences. With the smart plant care device, Jane can place sensors in the soil around each plant to monitor soil moisture and humidity levels. The device notifies her via a mobile app when the conditions are not optimal for a particular plant. If the soil is too dry, the system activates a motorized water pump to provide the necessary moisture. This helps Jane maintain an ideal environment for each plant, leading to healthier and thriving greenery.

**Use Instance #2 (Jessica): Energy-Efficient Power Generation**

Jessica is passionate about sustainable living and wants to reduce her reliance on traditional energy sources. She installs the miniature turbine or Temperature Stirling Engine in her backyard. The device harnesses mechanical energy from wind or temperature differentials and converts it into electrical power. Jessica uses this renewable energy source to power outdoor lighting, charge small electronic devices, or even contribute to her home's energy grid. The system provides an eco-friendly and cost-effective solution, allowing Jessica to contribute to energy conservation while enjoying the benefits of renewable power generation.

# **Design Ideation**

Being influenced by the criticism of consumers online and our determination to our team goals as well as our team charter, we have created a band of ideas generated during our brainstorming process. We have also ranked them into separate categories that determine whether they are the most effective to least effective. Out of all our ideas, we have created a band of ideas generated during our brainstorming process:



* **Wind-powered turbine:** A miniature device that harnesses the power of wind, which in turn can be converted into electrical energy.
* **A thermostat that waters plants:** A simple little tool that can sense the moisture of a plant's soil and determine when to apply water from a small hose.
* **Thermal Powered Engine:** A Stirling engine that can convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, which in turn can be converted into electrical energy using a motor.

**Description: **A miniature turbine is to be used to capture wind and convert it into electricity. The turbine can be placed at high levels such as the roof of a house or in windy environments. The device will also notify users if it is in the right position depending on its sensors detecting wind speed and temperature. As the components are settled on top of the base, there will be another sensor that would read the temperature of the soil for plants.



* **Temperature engine**

**Description:**

The device will convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, which will also become electrical power so that users may want to power up something small. As the flywheel of the engine rotates, the motor will capture its circular motion which would then convert it into electricity. The engine can run on both low and high-temperature states, so placing it in Arizona’s hot and dry climate could be an efficient way for obtaining power without emitting CO2 that could harm the environment.

**Description:**

A device will have a sensor that can detect whether the soil of a plant is in either dry or wet setting. If the soil is not in the required moisture suitable for the plant, a hose pump will automatically water the plant. While users are not available to ensure the quality of their house plant, the device will help maintain the life of the plant. Using a pipe as an insulator, it will carry the appropriate amount of water that will be used in a day.

_(Design concept for our product)_

We have selected a device that will detect whether the soil of a plant is in either a dry or wet setting, perhaps the best idea we’ve selected from our design concept chart. If the soil is not in the required moisture suitable for the plant, a hose pump will automatically water the plant. While users are not available to ensure the quality of their house plant, the device will help maintain the life of the plant. Using a pipe as an insulator, it will carry the appropriate amount of water that will be used in a day. We decided to choose this design as our main focus since it includes all the necessary components required for the course and as well as it not too difficult to construct. We have also tried combining the ideas from the design ideation by trying to make the product easy and sufficient to use for consumers. 

**Final Block Diagram**

Here is our block diagram with the selected components and a brief description of the parts and layout that will be used. As we can see below, each team member is given the responsibility to be in charge of their respective parts. We have added some changes that included removing previous components connected to the team's microcontroller. The design meets our product requirements by using sensors that correspond to the environment.

## **Final Component Selection**

For each of our components, we will research at least 3 different products. Provide a picture of the product, showing the price for each component, a link to the datasheet, and a description. Finally, to identify the pros and cons for each component. These components help meet our product requirements because the selected motor and temperature sensor will control the temperature of a house plant and help make life easier when it’s a machine watering, so no more human labor.

**Power Budget**

The power budget has helped us in finding the right amount of voltage needed for every selected component in our product design. However, since we are running our project with a 9-volt battery as our power supply and our motor is required to be run at with a 12-volt as read from our budget, it influenced us to create a voltage regulator that would power an appropriate current to our different power-required components.

_(Team’s Final PCB)_

The schematic presented will help satisfy our user needs in using a sensor that can correspond with environmental conditions. The project as a whole will also be a simple design, have accurate tracking in temperature recording, and be easy to use. Our decision-making in creating our PCB had to be based on the team members' separate subsystems which would all then be created into one board connected to our selected microcontroller. One item added in later on was our voltage regulator and jumper connectors used to connect our Wi-Fi module. However, based on some recent errors we have encountered in the making of the final PCB, some of the traces were not in their designated voltage, so we had to manually cross-wire. If we were to create another version of our team’s final PCB Design or add improvements to the Hardware Implementation, our team would possibly add more traces leading the jump connectors in case of emergencies so we won’t have to face the same trouble in the future.

The functionality of this software satisfies user needs and product requirements through an in-depth discussion of function: The software will satisfy the user's needs by providing the necessary functionality for an artificial watering system. Once the sensor reads a target degree, it will send a signal to the microcontroller which in turn will have the motor run and pump out water until the temperature of the soil changes. Our team's design and decision-making process related to this section was to create effective software that would limit the use of human labor in watering a home plant. 5 of the biggest changes we have made to our design since the software proposal include removing certain components that were once added earlier on, the directions of the arrows displayed on the diagram, fewer text bubbles displaying what the software is doing, modifying more on the Main Loop and Temp Process, and adding the final version of our Motor Trigger Subsystem. Perhaps some changes that could be made to our proposal in another version is to include a push button that can allow users to manually pump water from the product's motor by sending a message via the software, have a program that can display a message of the temperature on an LCD screen if we were to ever include one, and find other ways on how we can use the wifi module with the software since the usage of it on our coding is minimal.

**Version 2.0**

Creating a “Version 2.0” of our software design, we would have to improve both the Temperature sensor and Motor regulator. Although our project did not meet the expectations in the end, there were minor issues and ways to improve the old design. First, would be the Temperature sensor which was the main part of the project that would allow the motor to run based on the given temperature reading taken from the dirt. The purpose of the Temp sensor is to indicate how warm or cold the given plant is in the dirt, as it feels warm at a certain temperature, it will send signals to the motor drive, towards the water pump motor to pump water to the given plant. It also would also indicate if it already has water to stop pumping water. So, to improve the software design, we would replace the temp sensor with a humanity sensor which would allow me to measure the temperature at an exact time and perhaps have the temperature to provide a given reading that could provide a backup sensor. As for the motor, we should provide another fan that would allow the plant to be at a cooler temperature from the scorching hot sun.** **The UML Diagram represents the individual subsystem that would help determine the given details and values of each subsystem. It helps us understand the values such as the given voltage of both the motor and the sensor, as well as the max and min of what the temperature reads. The given functions and code would be based on past assignments and ICCs as well as researching the appropriate commands for each and individual subsystems. Based on the development of the code, we used similar codes such as the Temp Sensor and the motor driver which changed the given pins to the respective micro-controller that we purchased. We would use all the codes into a combined code with the respective EUSART, TIMER, and RX/TX to communicate within  MPLAB SNAP and MQTT. The given changes that we would like to add is another pin towards the newly added humanity sensor with the temperature sensor and perhaps another for the motor as well but overall, not much to change. As we move further into our projects, the protocol design should be similar to small changes as we continue with our water pump project. Ways to improve the features and each subsystem would rely on one another as they communicate through Wifi and to make it interactive and fun for people of all ages.

# **Lessons Learned**

1)  To have a simple design that is set in stone from the beginning as trying to make designs or ideas that are more complicated can end up hurting you as time is a factor.

2) Create multiple PCBs for your final design project in case of errors and any other issues that might arise. Always having a backup plan will help in the long run.

3) Using the same communication methods in regards to I2C and SPI as they both have their own difficulties and using one of each can be difficult to troubleshoot at times.

4) Choosing good parts with detailed datasheets as they will help with further troubleshooting. Providing any detail that might make/break your project.

5) Working alone is never a good idea and asking for help with your team should not be looked down on as the whole point of working as an engineer is to work together with your team. 

6) Getting a good quality board printed whether it's from the Peralta lab or JLC asking for a solder mask to be inputted on the boards will help with soldering. 

7) Having proper communication with the team is important as everyone needs to be on the same page. If someone does not try to work with the team then it really does hurt the team and can slow things down. 

8) Replacing components instead of troubleshooting could be easier and quicker as time is always a factor in getting your project down and sometimes just replacing the part will resolve the issues cheaper and won’t hurt in the long run.

9) Order multiple components of each part needed for the project in case extra parts are needed or some come faulty from the supplier. It’s always good to have some to test as well. 

10) Creating meeting times with your team can help boost morale and productivity. We believe to be successful you must create some chemistry between the team members.

**Recommendations for future students**



1. Complete all ICCs and HWs which can help toward the Final Project as well as learn new commands when coding.
2. Check up with your given group once or twice a week to provide feedback or updates for any projects or team assignments.
3. Remember to take responsibility for your own work, it is okay to ask for help from either the instructor or TA for assistance.
4. Helping one another, remember it is important to work as a team in order to understand and complete the given work.
5. Be in class on time and attend every lecture, since every class would learn something new that can be helpful toward any future assignments and for the Final Project.
