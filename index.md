**Introduction**
---
Our teamâ€™s objective is to invent a product that can help users and have a great effect on the environment. We will also be implementing the uses of sensors and motors that can help create a sturdy system where it is possible to measure weather parameters including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Our planned products are to be developed as user-friendly as well as create an intuitive user interface for configuring and monitoring the environment. We also want to ensure a secure MQTT communication in which we will be implementing a communication system using the MQTT protocol to securely transmit environmental data over WiFi where we can prioritize data integrity and confidentiality to ensure the information is transmitted properly and efficiently.
