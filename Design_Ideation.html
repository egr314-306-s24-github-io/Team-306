            Being influenced by the criticism of consumers online and our determination to our team goals as well as our team charter, we have created a band of ideas generated during our brainstorming process. We have also ranked them into separate categories that determine whether they are the most effective to least effective. Out of all our ideas, we have selected four drafts that we are still focusing on how they can be used for purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wind-powered turbine - a miniature device that harnesses the power of wind, which in turn can be converted into electrical energy.</li>
            <li>A thermostat that waters plants - a simple little tool that can sense the moisture of a plant's soil and determine when to apply water from a small hose.</li>
            <li>A toy that tells users what to wear - a device that offers suggestions for users on what to wear depending on the climate of the day.</li>
            <li>Thermal Powered Engine- a Stirling engine that can convert thermal energy into mechanical energy, which in turn can be converted into electrical energy using a motor.</li>
        </ul>
