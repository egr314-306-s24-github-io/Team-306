# Team Organization


Charter

As a team, we will commit to upholding these goals and working collaboratively to achieve the mission of creating an exceptional design that fits all requirements needed for the project. We recognize the importance of innovation, reliability, and sustainability in our project, and will work as hard as we can to ensure that we succeed. 

Mission Statement 

The objective of team 306 is to create a product that is eco-friendly and low on budget, whether it’s reading humidity percentage in the air, moisture in the soil, or conserving power. One of our ideas was to create a device that could tell the humidity in the air or moisture in the soil around a plant using sensors so it could help notify users if the plant is in the right climate and perhaps using a motor to create a water pump to help moisture the plant’s dry surroundings. Another idea was to conserve energy with a miniature Turbine or a Temperature Stirling Engine that can convert its mechanical energy into electrical power.
